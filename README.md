# geotweets

I chose to make a comparison of tweets in the United States from two different time periods. The first time period was from around 10:00pm to 10:30pm and the seconds time period was from about 10:00am to 10:30am. The reason that I chose to do this is because I wanted to analyze the difference in behavior across the coasts of the United States at different times. I am from Florida and a lot of my family and friends live there. I have notices that its hard to keep in touch with them sometimes because of the time change. 10:00pm PST is 1:00am EST where most people are probably going to bed. I expected there to be less activity on the east coast at that time compared to the second time period that I chose. Below are maps of the data that I collected from the tweets.

As you can see in these maps, there is a significant increase in tweets from the east coast in the second time period where there are probably more people awake. 1:00pm is around the time that a lot of people will take lunch breaks and have some time to go on their phones and maybe tweet. I can use this information to try and schedule better times to talk with family and friends that live on the east coast.
